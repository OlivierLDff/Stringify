# Stringify

## Dependencies

* [QSuperMacros](https://github.com/OlivierLDff/QSuperMacros.git) : A set of macros to declare getter and setter and avoid boilerplate code. We use it to declare QPROPERTY and keep the declaration as simple as possible
* [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) : Unit and mock testing framework

## Building

Building the library is as simple as any other **cmake** projects.
